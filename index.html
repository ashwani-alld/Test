  <h3>Climate</h3>
  <p>Allahabad has a humid subtropical climate common to cities in the plains of North India, designated Cwa in the KÃ¶ppen climate classification.[105] The annual mean temperature is 26.1 Â°C (79.0 Â°F); monthly mean temperatures are 18â€“29 Â°C (64â€“84
    Â°F).[106] Allahabad has three seasons: a hot, dry summer, a cool, dry winter and a hot, humid monsoon. Summer lasts from March to September with daily highs reaching up to 48 Â°C in the dry summer (from March to May) and up to 40 Â°C in the hot and
    extremely humid monsoon season (from June to September).[106] The monsoon begins in June, and lasts till August; high humidity levels prevail well into September. Winter runs from December to February,[107] with temperatures rarely dropping to
    the freezing point. The daily average maximum temperature is about 22 Â°C (72 Â°F) and the minimum about 9 Â°C (48 Â°F).[108] Allahabad never receives snow,[109] but, experiences dense winter fog due to numerous wood fires, coal fires, and open
    burning of rubbishâ€”resulting in substantial traffic and travel delays.[107] Its highest recorded temperature is 48 Â°C (118.4 Â°F), and its lowest is âˆ’2 Â°C (28 Â°F).[106][110]</p>
  <p>Rain from the Bay of Bengal or the Arabian Sea branches of the southwest monsoon[111] falls on Allahabad from June to September, supplying the city with most of its annual rainfall of 1,027 mm (40 in).[109] The highest monthly rainfall total,
    333 mm (13 in), occurs in August.[112] The city receives 2,961 hours of sunshine per year, with maximum sunlight in May.[110]
